# A Rate Limit Bypass Lab
**`This is a dedicated laboratory developed using Python to bypass rate limits.‚è≥`**
This is a Flask-based web application that implements a two-factor authentication system using one-time passwords (OTP) and rate limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks. Users can enter their phone number to receive an OTP for verification. The system tracks the number of failed attempts and imposes a 10-minute lockout after three unsuccessful tries. It also employs rate limiting to restrict access for users attempting to bypass the system. This implementation provides a simple dashboard for user management and security.

<br>
<li>Install Dependencies: To run this application, you'll need the Flask library. You can install it using pip:</li>
<br>

**`pip install Flask`**
<br>
**`pip install flask-session`**
<li>Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the code:</li>
<br>

**`python app.py`**

>After following these steps, your application should be running and accessible at **http://127.0.0.1:5000** in your web browser.

<br>

>To run this Python Flask application, ensure you have Python installed. Then, install Flask using pip install Flask. Finally, execute the script with python app.py. Access the application at **http://127.0.0.1:5000**

<h2>Method of bypassing the laboratory:</h2>

**`After running the script, enter your phone number to navigate to the OTP page. Subsequently, input incorrect OTPs three times to induce a rate limit on the number.`**
**`After applying the rate limit, capture the OTP request using Burp Suite. Then, modify the request in the repeater as follows: `**

**`This laboratory has been developed for educational purposes. As a result, it does not connect to a database and is solely designed to teach rate limit bypass techniques. A Persian tutorial video has been published on the Telegram channel @rmsup.`**
